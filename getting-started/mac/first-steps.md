# First Steps

This article will guide you through the basics of __Telerik UI for Xamarin__ and how to start using the suite on __Mac__.

Once you have your first simple Xamarin control up and running, take a look at the __Next Steps__ section to explore other control functionality.

## Download the Controls

When you have an active trial or developer license, you can download the following files:

* Standalone installation
* Assemblies for manual installation
* NuGet packages
* Old versions

>If you are not a customer, you can [download a free, fully functional trial](https://www.telerik.com/download-trial-file/v2-b/ui-for-xamarin?file=pkg) and the same options will apply to you as well.

>tip Make sure you have already read the [System Requirements]({% slug system-requirements %}) article before you proceed.

Follow the steps below in order to download the installation files:

1. Log into your [Telerik account](https://www.telerik.com/account/) and click on the __Downloads__ tab.
