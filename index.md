#Welcome to UI for Xamarin#

##Overview##

Telerik UI for Xamarin is a collection of Xamarin.Forms controls and Xamarin bindings built on top of the native Telerik UI for iOS and UI for Android suites. The Xamarin.Forms controls also utilize controls and features from the Telerik UI for UWP, providing common API that allows the developer to use the native Telerik components on all three mobile platforms (iOS / Android / Windows) using a single shared code base. In addition you get access to the full set of controls in UI for Xamarin.IOS, Xamarin.Android and UI for UWP.

##Supported mobile versions##
You can use UI for Xamarin.Forms for application development for the following mobile operating systems:

|FOLDERS 						|CONTENTS |
|:---								|:---			|
|`/apptemplates`		|The folder contains standalone starter templates. Although they are static HTML files, it is recommended that you open them through a web server instead of directly from the file system. The latter approach breaks all Ajax data requests.|
|`/examples`				|Accommodates the quick-start demo files. Although they are static HTML files, it is recommended that you open them through a web server instead of directly from the file system. The latter approach breaks all Ajax data requests.|
|`/js`							|Contains the minified JavaScript files.|
|`/src`							|This folder used to hold the source code files, but they are now provided in a separate download package. Access the source code package from the [Downloads section](https://www.telerik.com/account/my-downloads) of your account. Note that the source code is _not_ available to trial users.|
|`/styles`					|Consists of the minified CSS files and theme images. The folder also includes the LESS files, which can be passed to the compiler, located on the first-level folders inside `styles/folder: styles/web/` and `styles/mobile/`. Note that the LESS files are _not_ available in the trial version.|
|`/wrappers`				|Includes the server-side wrappers. As it is necessary for the UI for ASP.NET MVC, UI for JSP or UI for PHP distributions only, the folder is available in the commercial packages of these versions.|
|`changelog.html`		|Provides the Kendo UI release notes.|
