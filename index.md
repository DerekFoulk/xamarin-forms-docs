**Telerik UI for Xamarin** is a collection of Xamarin.Forms controls and Xamarin bindings built on top of the native Telerik UI for iOS and UI for Android suites. The Xamarin.Forms controls also utilize controls and features from the Telerik UI for Windows Phone, providing common API that allows the developer to use the native Telerik components on all three mobile platforms (iOS / Android / WP) using a single shared code base.

> Important Note: The current documentation set provides information about the features and API of the Xamarin.Forms controls only.

### Xamarin.Forms Controls Overview ###

- [**Chart for Xamarin.Forms**]({% slug chart-overview %}): A feature rich charting control that supports different chart types and series. Its intuitive object model and public API allow you to easily setup complex charts and integrate them into your application.
- [**Calendar for Xamarin.Forms**]({% slug calendar-overview %}): With this calendar control you can easily implement various calendar scenarios in your apps. The control capitalizes on all the innate benefits of the native UI but exposes the objects and properties in C#, allowing for no-compromise customization and flexibility. 

You can use **Xamarin.Forms** for application development for the following mobile operating systems:

* **Android 4.0** or higher
* **iOS 7.0** or higher
* **Windows Phone 8**

> Note: There could be information for more controls in the UI for iOS and UI for Android than what is supported by the Xamarin bindings. For a list of the supported controls, you can refer to the [UI for Xamarin](http://www.telerik.com/xamarin-ui) product page.
