# Introduction #

Welcome to the official documentation of **Telerik UI for Xamarin.Forms**

## What is Telerik UI for Xamarin.Forms ##

You can use **Xamarin.Forms** for application development for the following mobile operating systems:

* **Android 4.0** or higher
* **iOS 6.1** or higher
* **Windows Phone 8**

Telerik provides libraries of native UI components for each of the listed platforms. The **Telerik UI for Xamarin.Forms** wraps the native components and provides a common API that allows the developers to use the native Telerik components in shared projects build with Xamarin.Forms.

You can find more information about Xamarin.Forms at this link: [An Introduction to Xamarin.Forms](http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/xamarin-forms/introduction-to-xamarin-forms/)

After you read the [System Requirements]({% slug system-requirements %}) section, you can go to the [Getting Started]({% slug getting-started %}) section where you can find step-by-step instructions how to get started using our components.

## Controls Overview ##

### Chart ###

The [Telerik Chart for Xamarin]({% slug chart-overview %}) is a feature-rich, intuitive and easy to use data visualization control which employs the Xamarin.Forms technology and allows you to build native iOS, Android and Windows Phone apps in C#. For the Xamarin wrapper lovers, Telerik Chart comes also in the form of Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Android wrappers on top of the native Telerik iOS and Android suites.

While Chart for Xamarin capitalizes all the innate benefits of the native UI, it exposes its objects and properties in C#, allowing for no-compromise customization and flexibility. Using Telerik Chart along with the Xamarin.Forms technology allows developers to easily implement various chart scenarios in their apps from a single shared C# code base.
