**Telerik UI for Xamarin** is a collection of Xamarin.Forms controls and Xamarin bindings built on top of the native Telerik UI for iOS and UI for Android suites. The Xamarin.Forms controls also utilize controls and features from the Telerik UI for Windows Phone, providing common API that allows the developer to use the native Telerik components on all three mobile platforms (iOS / Android / WP) using a single shared code base.

> Important Note: The current documentation set provides information about the features and API of the Xamarin.Forms controls only.

### Xamarin.Forms Controls Overview ###

- [**Calendar for Xamarin.Forms**]({% slug calendar-overview %}): With this calendar control you can easily implement various calendar scenarios in your apps. The control capitalizes on all the innate benefits of the native UI but exposes the objects and properties in C#, allowing for no-compromise customization and flexibility. 
- [**Chart for Xamarin.Forms**]({% slug chart-overview %}): A feature rich charting control that supports different chart types and series. Its intuitive object model and public API allow you to easily setup complex charts and integrate them into your application.
- [**DataForm for Xamarin.Forms**]({% slug dataform-overview %}): The Telerik DataForm for Xamarin.Forms helps you to quickly build various forms such as: registration, data entry, login, etc. The control displays data objectâ€™s properties in a list form which can be read-only or editable by the end-users.
- [**ListView for Xamarin.Forms**]({% slug listview-overview %}): It packs all essential features associated with a ListView scenario - load-on-demand, pull-to-refresh, grouping, different layouts and more. To simplify the data consumption and data shaping, the ListView for Xamarin.Forms is integrated internally with Telerik DataSource for iOS and Android. The Datasource control serves as an intermediary between the raw data to be displayed and the UI component. 
- [**SideDrawer for Xamarin.Forms**]({% slug sidedrawer-overview %}): It extends the popular slide-out design pattern which is mainly associated with navigational purposes. It allows developers to embed any content inside the sliding panel - from text and icons to sliders and filters.

You can use **Xamarin.Forms** for application development for the following mobile operating systems:

* **Android 4.0** or higher
* **iOS 7.0** or higher
* **Windows Phone 8**
* **Windows Universal 8.1**

> Note: There could be information for more controls in the UI for iOS and UI for Android than what is supported by the Xamarin bindings. For a list of the supported controls, you can refer to the [UI for Xamarin](http://www.telerik.com/xamarin-ui) product page.
