# Developer Focused Examples

**Telerik UI for Xamarin** provides an easy-to-use infrastructure with many developer focused examples demonstrating our Xamarin controls. You can review the source code of each example and familiarize with the configuration possibilities that each it provides.

## SDK Browser Application

The SDK Browser is an application that shows both getting started and feature-specific examples. It can found on your computer in the **/[installation-path]/UI for Xamarin [version]/Examples/Forms** folder or you can directly explore the code in the [SDKBrowser Examples repository on GitHub](https://github.com/telerik/xamarin-forms-sdk/tree/master/XamarinSDK/SDKBrowser/SDKBrowser/Examples). 

> Repository Note: When cloning a repository, you can restore the Telerik assembly references in one of three ways; 1) Copy and paste the **Binaries** folder from the UI for Xamarin installation folder to the **xamarin-forms-sdk/XamarinSDK folder** in your local copy of the repository, 2) Update the references directly or 3) Use the [Telerik NuGet server]({% slug telerik-nuget-server %}) and install the Telerik.UI.for.Xamarin package

## QSF Application

The **QSF application** is another useful resource that shows the **Telerik UI for Xamarin** controls in different **Xamarin.Forms** projects and scenarios. This demo doesn't use all of the available features each control, but instead is intended to show them in highly-polished, use case-specific, scenarios.

This application can be found in the **/[installation-path]/UI for Xamarin [version]/QSF/** folder or you can explore the code directly on in the [QSF Examples repository on GitHub](https://github.com/telerik/telerik-xamarin-forms-samples/tree/master/_Samples%20Application). 

## Native-only Examples

Solutions that show how to use the controls when developing through **Xamarin.Android** or **Xamarion.iOS** are available in the **Examples** folder as well. Respectively, they are separated in different folders - iOS and Android.
