# Developer-Focused Examples

**Telerik UI for Xamarin** provides an easy-to-use infrastructure with many developer focused examples demonstrating our Xamarin controls. You can review the source code of each example and familiarize with the configuration possibilities that each it provides.

There are two sets of demos showing Telerik Xamarin.Forms controls: the **QSF Application** and the **SDK Browser Application**. In this topic you can read what is the purpose of each and how they both are useful.

## SDK Browser Application

The SDKBrowser is a set of various examples that explain how to use the features of a control without the complexity that extra styling and polish can add to an application. It's the go-to source for "how do I use X in Y control". Most of the code snippets available in the documentation are directly generated from that demo (you can see special comments in the code for this).

SDKBrowser application can be accessed in two ways:

* It can be found on your computer in the **/[installation-path]/Telerik UI for Xamarin [version]/Examples/Forms** folder;
* You can directly explore the code in the [SDKBrowser Examples repository on GitHub](https://github.com/telerik/xamarin-forms-sdk/tree/master/XamarinSDK/SDKBrowser/SDKBrowser/Examples). 

	> Repository Note: When cloning a repository, you can restore the Telerik assembly references in one of three ways:
	>* Copy and paste the **Binaries** folder from the UI for Xamarin installation folder to the **xamarin-forms-sdk/XamarinSDK folder** in your local copy of the repository, 
	>* Update the references directly;
	>* Use the [Telerik NuGet server]({% slug telerik-nuget-server %}) and install the Telerik.UI.for.Xamarin package

## QSF Application

The QSF, is the "Telerik UI for Xamarin Demos" app that you see in the app stores (Windows Store, Google Play and Apple App Store). It is highly polished and has many scenario-specific use cases designed to show off a smaller subset of features.

The QSF application can be accessed in the following ways:

* It can be found in the **/[installation-path]/Telerik UI for Xamarin [version]/QSF/** folder;
* You can explore the code directly in the [QSF Examples repository on GitHub](https://github.com/telerik/telerik-xamarin-forms-samples/tree/master/_Samples%20Application);
* It can be installed from the corresponding app store (Google Play, Apple App Store or Windows Store).

## Native-only Examples

Solutions that show how to use the controls when developing through **Xamarin.Android** or **Xamarion.iOS** are available in the **Examples** folder as well. Respectively, they are separated in different folders - iOS and Android.
