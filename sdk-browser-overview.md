# Developer Focused Examples

**Telerik UI for Xamarin** provides an easy-to-use infrastructure with many developer focused examples demonstrating our Xamarin controls.

## SDK Browser Application

Some examples are provided via Ð° Visual Studio Xamarin.Forms solution under the name __Xamarin.Forms SDK Browser__. 

The SDK Browser can be downloaded from the __[telerik/xamarin-forms-sdk](https://github.com/telerik/xamarin-forms-sdk)__ GitHub repository. The code specific for each demo can be found in the following folder from the repository: [telerik/xamarin-forms-sdk/XamarinSDK/SDKBrowser/SDKBrowser/Examples](https://github.com/telerik/xamarin-forms-sdk/tree/master/XamarinSDK/SDKBrowser/SDKBrowser/Examples). 

> To link the Telerik dlls with the SDK Browser you can **copy the Binaries folder** from the UI for Xamarin installation folder. Then **paste it in the xamarin-forms-sdk/XamarinSDK folder** in your local copy of the repository.

## QSF Application

The **QSF application** is another useful resource that shows the **Telerik UI for Xamarin** controls in different **Xamarin.Forms** projects and scenarios. The application can be found in the QSF folder of your local installation. You can review the source code of each example and familiarize with the configuration possibilities that each it provides.

## Native Examples

Solutions that show how to use the controls when developing through **Xamarin.Android** or **Xamarion.iOS** are available in the **Examples** folder as well. Respectively, they are separated in different folders - iOS and Android.
