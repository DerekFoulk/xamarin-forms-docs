# Installing Telerik UI for Xamarin from MSI file #

To install Telerik UI for Xamarin on your machine from the Windows Installer MSI file, follow the instructions below:

1. Go to to the Telerik UI for Xamarin download page following the instructions in [Download Product Files]({%slug download-product-files%}) topic.

2. Download the automatic installation (MSI) file.

3. Once the download completes, **run the MSI file** and follow the instructions. On a 32bit machine the wizard will install the UI for Xamarin component in the following folder unless you specify otherwise: *C:\Program Files\Telerik\* or *C:\Program Files (x86)\Telerik\* for a 64bit machine.

> If you prefer using the ZIP file with the dlls instead of the automatic installation you can check the [Manual Installation for Visual Studio]({%slug manual-installation-support%}) help article.

#### Exploring the installation folder

If you open the installation folder you will probably note the following sub directories:

* Binaries
* Examples
* LicenseAgreements
* QSF
* VSExtensions
