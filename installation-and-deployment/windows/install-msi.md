# Download Steps #

To install UI for Xamarin on your machine from the Windows Installer MSI file, follow the instructions below:

1. Log into your Telerik account and click on **Downloads** from the top menu.

2. In the list with all available products find **UI for Xamarin Cross-Platform**, and click on it. This will open the page with all available downloads for the product.

3. Here you can **download the automatic installation (MSI) file**. Or the ZIP file with the dlls.

4. Once the download completes, **run the MSI file** and follow the instructions. On a 32bit machine the wizard will install the UI for Xamarin component in the following folder unless you specify otherwise: *C:\Program Files\Telerik\* or *C:\Program Files (x86)\Telerik\* for a 64bit machine.

> If you prefer using the ZIP file with the dlls instead of the automatic installation you can check the [Manual Installation for Visual Studio]({%slug manual-installation-support%}) help article.
