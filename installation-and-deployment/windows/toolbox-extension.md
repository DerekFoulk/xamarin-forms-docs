# Telerik UI for Xamarin Toolbox

This article introduces Telerik UI for Xamarin Toolbox for Visual Studio which eases the process of adding Telerik controls to your Xamarin.Forms application. The Xamarin Toolbox is part of the **Visual Studio Extensions** for Telerik UI for Xamarin.

Visual Studio Extensions for Telerik UI for Xamarin are distributed with the Telerik UI for Xamarin [MSI installation]({%slug install-msi%}). They also can be downloaded and installed as separate product from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/) for Visual Studio 2017/2019.

>For detailed instructions on how to install the Visual Studio Extensions, go to [Installing VSExtensions]({%slug vs-extensions%}) topic.

## Showing the Telerik Toolbox

In order to show the Toolbox and start using the controls, you should navigate to "Extensions" -> "Telerik" -> "Telerik UI for Xamarin" -> "Open Telerik UI for Xamarin Toolbox" tab within Visual Studio. You can also find this option when typing "Telerik UI for Xamarin Toolbox" in the Quick Launch search field (top right corner in Visual Studio).

**Figure 1** shows where you can find the option in Visual Studio:

Once you have clicked the option you should be prompted to the window which contains the different controls from the suite.**Figure 2** shows the appearance of the toolbox if everything is correctly set.

>important If no usable controls are present in the toolbox - make sure all the required references are added and try rebuilding your project. 

## Adding Controls to Your Project

Embedding the controls from the suite is made as easy as possible and all you need to do is simply drag one of the controls within your XAML file. This will add the control definition and will also map the needed namespace declarations. **Figure 2** shows how the action is performed.
