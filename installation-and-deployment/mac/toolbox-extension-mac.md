# TelerikXamarinForms Toolbox

When you download the latest version of **Telerik UI for Xamarin** from our website you need to open the Visual Studio Extension Manager and install the latest Telerik UI for Xamarin ProjectTemplate.mpack file to it. For more details check the article about [Project Wizard]({%slug project-wizard%}) for Visual Studio for Mac.  

## Showing the Telerik Toolbox

In order to show the Toolbox and start using the controls, you should navigate to the StartPage.xaml file in your project and clicked on it. If the ProjectTemplate.mpack file is installed successfully, Toolbox window is visible in the project when you clicked on the StartPage.xaml file. You can also find this option when typing “Toolbox” in the Search filed (top right corner in Visual Studio for Mac).
**Figure 1** and **Figure 2** shows where you can find the options in Visual Studio for Mac:

Once you have clicked the option you should be prompted to the window which contains the different controls from the suite. **Figure 1** and **Figure 2** shows the appearance of the toolbox if everything is correctly set.

>important If no usable controls are present in the toolbox - make sure all the required references are added and try rebuilding your project. 

## Adding Controls to Your Project

Embedding the controls from the suite is made as easy as possible and all you need to do is simply drag one of the controls within your XAML file. This will add the control definition and will also map the needed namespace declarations. **Figure 3** shows how the action is performed.
