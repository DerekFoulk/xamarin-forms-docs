# System Requirements #

You can develop cross-platform applications with Xamarin.Forms on the following operating systems:

* **Windows**
* **OS X** 10.8 *Mountain Lion* or newer

## Development Environment ##
In order to develop applications with **Telerik UI for Xamarin.Forms** you need to have the following development tools installed:

* **Windows**: **[Xamarin Studio](http://xamarin.com/download)**: You will be able to develop **Android** apps.  
You can also use **Visual Studio** as development environment if your [Xamarin license](https://store.xamarin.com/) provides support for it. You will need **Visual Studio 2012** + **.NET 4.5** or **Visual Studio 2013** or higher. This will also allow you to develop **Windows Phone** apps, you will need the **[Windows Phone SDK](https://dev.windows.com/en-us/develop/download-phone-sdk)** installed.
* **OS X**:  **[Xamarin Studio](http://xamarin.com/download)**: you will be able to develop **Android** and **iOS** apps. Windows Phone apps are not supported on OS X.

> If you only have Visual Studio 2015 installed, you may see "X" mark for Xamarin Project Templates on Customization step in the installer. This is because currently project templates are not installed on VS 2015.  We will add templates support for VS 2015 in one of our future releases. Still, you can install the product and use the assemblies and examples.
