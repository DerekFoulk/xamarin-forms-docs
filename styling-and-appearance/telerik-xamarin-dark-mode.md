# Overview

Android 10 (API level 29) and iOS 13 introduce system-wide dark appearance for all user interface elements, known as [Dark theme](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/look-and-feel/darktheme) for Android and [Dark Mode](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/supporting_dark_mode_in_your_interface) for iOS. They have many benefits as to allow users to toggle their interface and focus on the applicationâ€™s content based on ambient lighting conditions as well as to reduce power usage amount depending on the device's screen technology.

Telerik UI for Xamarin controls have a support for Dark Theme/Dark Mode from the R1 2021 Official Release.

## Dark Theme for Android

In order to support Dark theme for Android, the application's theme must inherit from a DayNight theme as explained [here](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/look-and-feel/darktheme#supporting_dark_theme_in_your_app).

Example:

Set the app theme inside the Resources/valies/styles.xml file locaded in the Android project.

```xml
<style name="MainTheme" parent="Theme.AppCompat.DayNight">
```
