# RadDataSource: Overview

**RadDataSource** is a class that can easily filter, sort and group data in a collection or array. The data source exposes three collections for filtering, sorting and grouping allowing developers to define
an arbitrary data view. Furthermore RadDataSource provides automatic change notifications and is fully integrated with the standard Android ListView as well as RadListView.

To use RadDataSource developers must add dependencies to the **Common** and **Data** libraries.
