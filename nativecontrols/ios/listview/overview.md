# ListViewfor Xamarin.iOS: Overview



The Telerik ListView for iOS provides the most frequently used functionalities associated with a ListView scenario in one and the same framework eliminating the overhead of integrating multiple solutions from different authors. To make working with data easier for developers, the control works seamlessly with the Telerik DataSource control, which serves as a mediator between the raw data that needs to be displayed and the UI component.
