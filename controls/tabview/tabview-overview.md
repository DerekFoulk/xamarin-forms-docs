# Overview

**Telerik TabView for Xamarin** is a flexible navigation control that allows you to build tabbed interfaces. Each tabview item has an associated content displayed on selection.

## Key features

* **Item Selection**: RadTabView exposes selection API which allows you as a developer to extend the navigation per application needs. For more details read the [Selection]({%slug tabview-key-features%}) topic.
* **Flexible header and content of the items**: You can easily customize the header and the content of the tabview items. Go to the [TabViewItem]({%slug tabview-item%}) topic for more information on this.
* **Customizable tab strip area position**: The tab strip can be positioned top or bottom. Go to [TabViewHeaderItem]({%slug tabview-header-item%}) article.
* **Support for Scrolling Tabs**: The tab strip area has configuration for scrolling the items inside. For more information go to [TabView Scrolling Tabs]({%slug tabview-scrolling-tabs%}) article.
* RadTabView gives you the ability to **swipe inside the content** in order to change the selected item. This scenario can be achieved with and without using animation. For more details review the [Key Features]({%slug tabview-key-features%}) article.
* **Layout option for overflow tabs**: If there are too many items in the TabView control and they cannot fit into the tab strip area, a customizable overflow button will be displayed.
