# Expand and Collapse Groups

**RadListView** supports groups expand and collapse operations either through the UI by tapping on the group headers or programmatically. By default, all the groups are expanded.

This help topic will provide an overview of the methods and commands used to control the expand/collapse state of the ListView groups.

>tip Before proceeding, please check the [Grouping]({%slug listview-features-grouping%}) topic which describes how you could enable the grouping feature of RadListView.

## Get the grouped ListView items

To manipulate the collapsible ListView groups, first you will need to call its **GetDataView** method. In short, GetDataView method provides a view of the ItemsSource after all the Sort, Group and Filter operations are applied.  The return type is *IDataViewCollection* which exposes the expand and collapse methods described in the following sections.

```C#
var dataView = this.listView.GetDataView();
```

## Expand and collapse all groups 

In order to expand all groups, use the **ExpandAll** method and respectively use the **CollapseAll** method - to collapse all groups.

```C#
//expand all
var dataView = this.listView.GetDataView();
dataView.ExpandAll();

//collapse all
var dataView = this.listView.GetDataView();
dataView.CollapseAll();
```

## Expand and collapse a certain group

You could retrieve the first-level groups through the **GetGroups** method of the *IDataViewCollection* object and use **ExpandGroup**/**CollapseGroup** to make a certain group to expand or collapse respectively. You could check whether a group is expanded trough the **GetIsExpanded** method.

Here is quick snippet on how these methods are used:

```C# 
var dataView = this.listView.GetDataView();
var rootGroups = dataView.GetGroups();

var isFirstExpanded = dataView.GetIsExpanded(rootGroups.First());
//expand a certain group
dataView.ExpandGroup(rootGroups.First());
//collapse a certain group
dataView.CollapseGroup(rootGroups.First());
```

Additionally, *IDataViewCollection* provides **ExpandItem**/**CollapseItem** methods that take a ListView item as a parameter and expand/collapse the immediate group containing this item.	

```C#
var lastItem = (listView.ItemsSource as IEnumerable<City>).Last();
var dataView = this.listView.GetDataView();
dataView.CollapseItem(lastItem);
```

## Handle GroupHeaderTap command

**GroupHeaderTap** command is raised when a group header of a grouped ListView is tapped. By default, tapping on a group header collapses the group if it is expanded and vice-versa.

By handling GroupHeaderTap command you could control the collapse/expand behavior of a certain group. The next example shows how to prevent the first-level groups from hiding their items.

>tip Please check [Commands]({%slug listview-features-commands%}) topic for information on how to use RadListView commands.

First, letâ€™s define the GroupHeaderTapCommand class that derives from ListViewCommand:

```C# 
	public class GroupHeaderTapCommand : ListViewCommand
	{
		public GroupHeaderTapCommand()
		{
			Id = CommandId.GroupHeaderTap;
		}
		public override bool CanExecute(object parameter)
		{
			return true;
		}
		public override void Execute(object parameter)
		{
			var context = parameter as GroupHeaderContext;
			if (context.Level > 1)
				context.IsExpanded = !context.IsExpanded;
		}
	}
```

And add the GroupHeaderTapCommand to the Commands collection of the ListView instance:

```C#
listView.Commands.Add(new GroupHeaderTapCommand());
```
