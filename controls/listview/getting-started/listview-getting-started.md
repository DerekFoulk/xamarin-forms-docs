# Getting Started

This example will guide you through the steps needed to add a basic **RadListView** control in your application.

>Before you proceed, please, take a look at these articles and follow the instructions to setup your app:

>- [Setup on Windows]({%slug getting-started-windows%})
>- [Setup on Mac]({%slug getting-started-mac%})

## Example

If your app is setup, you are ready to add a **RadListView** control.

First, lets create a simple data and view model classes:

<snippet id='listview-gettingstarted-source'/>

Here is the setup of the list view:

<snippet id='listview-gettingstarted-listview-xaml'/>
<snippet id='listview-gettingstarted-listview-csharp'/>

You have to add the following namespaces:

<snippet id='xmlns-teleriklistview'/>
<snippet id='ns-teleriklistview'/>

Finally set the list view as content of your page.

This is the result:

![RadListView](../images/listview-gettingstarted.png)
