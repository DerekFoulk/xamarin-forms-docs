# Overview

**Telerik TimeSpan Picker for Xamarin** provides an easy way to select a time duration. TimeSpan control represents a time interval and allows you to set a time range between two times measured in numbers of days, hours, minutes and seconds. The Flexible Styling API gives you the opportunity to fully customize the dialog appearance such as its header and footer.
