# Getting Started

This example will guide you through the steps needed to add a basic **RadRating** control in your application.

>Before you proceed, please, take a look at these articles and follow the instructions to setup your app:

## Example

If your app is setup, you are ready to add a **RadRating** control.

The simplest and fastest way to include the control is by simply defining it like this in XAML:

<snippet id='rating-gettingstarted-xaml'/>

or in code:

<snippet id='rating-gettingstarted-csharp'/>

By default the control is defined in a way that five start will be visualized and non of them will be selected.

You have to add the following namespaces:

<snippet id='xmlns-telerikrating'/>
<snippet id='ns-telerikrating'/>
