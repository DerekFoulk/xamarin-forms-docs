# Key Features

The purpose of this help article is to show you the key features of the **RadButton** control. 

## Content Alignment

RadButton exposes **HorizontalContentAlignment** and **VerticalContentAlignment** properties of type Xamarin.Forms.TextAlignment which you can use to set different positioning of its content. 

Here is a quick example how you can apply these:

<snippet id='button-features-contentalignment'/>

Where:

<snippet id='xmlns-telerikinput'/>

## Border Thickness

The **BorderThickness** property is of type Xamarin.Forms.Thickness and is used to set the bordersâ€™ width.  Type Thickness gives you the option to define different border on each side of the Button.

The snippet below demonstrates how BorderThickness could be defined.

<snippet id='button-features-borderthickness'/>

## Background Image

The **BackgroundImage** property is of type ImageSource and is used to set a graphic as a background of the RadButton control.   

The next snippet shows how you can apply the background image.

<snippet id='button-features-backgroundimage'/>

>In the example buttonBackground.png image is located in each of the application projects (Resources folder in iOS, Resources/Drawable folder in Android, and application root in UWP; each with the appropriate build action set). You can read more on loading and displaying images in Xamarin.Forms here:  [Xamarin.Forms -> User Interface-> Images](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/user-interface/images/#Local_Images).
