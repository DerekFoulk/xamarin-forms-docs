# Create Circle Button

&nbsp;

You could easily create circular buttons with RadButton by adjusting its Width, Height and BorderRadius properties following the next instructions:

* Width should be equal to Height;
* BorderRadius should be set to half Width/Height value;


> In some cases, you may need to set a BorderWidth value in order for BorderRadius to take effect.

Here is a quick example:
