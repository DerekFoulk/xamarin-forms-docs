## Key features

* **Hierarchical Navigation**: RadTreeView significantly improves the navigation and performance of your application where navigation over hierarchical structure is required.

* **Commands Support**: RadTreeView strictly follows the MVVM best practices and provides an intuitive and easy-to-use set of APIs that allow different aspects of the RadTreeView control’s behavior to be handled and/or completely overridden. RadTreeView exposes a Commands collection that allows you to register custom commands with each control’s instance through the RadTreeView's **Commands** property. 

* **CheckBox Support**: Telerik RadTreeView provides check boxes buttons displayed next to each item. The RadTreeView allows the user to check/uncheck the nodes and to perform various tasks with the collection of checked nodes. The Tri-State CheckBox mode of RadTreeView allows for RadTreeViewItems' CheckBoxes to have an additional, third state - Indeterminate.

* **Data Binding**: Simply setting the collection of custom business objects as an ItemsSource in combination with a "HierarchyAdapter" class is enough to visualize the hierarchically-structured source. 

* **UI Virtualization**: The user interface uses virtualization for displaying the required elements, meaning  that they are created only when needed and only for the currently visible cells.

* **Theming Support:** **RadTreeView** comes with built-in theming support that allows you to easily build slick interfaces with the look-and-feel of a predefined theme
