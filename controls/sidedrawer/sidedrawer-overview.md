# Overview
The **RadSideDrawer** component is designed to enable users to visualize a hidden view in their applications. That view can host navigation UI, common setting or any other UI typical for a View. It can be visualized using a flick gesture and can be shown from any of the four edges of the screen. In addition to the positioning feature, the **RadSideDrawer** supports transition animations that are applied to the opening and closing view. We provide several predefined animations that can be easily set or changed at runtime to meet our customersâ€™ requirements.

> **RadSideDrawer** is available for the following platforms:
> 
> - **Android**
> - **iOS**
> - **Windows 8.1**
> - **Windows Phone 8.1**
> - **Universal Windows Platform**
