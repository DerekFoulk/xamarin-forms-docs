## Key features ##

* **Validation**: RadMaskedInput control uses a mask to distinguish between proper and improper user input. Validation mechanism can be based on custom regular expressions or built-in tokens. Read more about this in the [Tokens Validation]({% slug maskedinput-features-mask-tokens %}) and [RegEx Validation]({% slug maskedinput-features-mask-extensions %}) topics. 
* **Mask Tokens**: You could choose from a set of predefined tokens in order to restrict userâ€™s input.  For more details on the available tokens go to [Tokens Validation]({% slug maskedinput-features-mask-tokens %}) topic.
* **Commands**: MaskedInput allows you to attach commands that will be executed when certain actions, such as ApplyMaskStarted and ApplyMaskFinished occur. For detailed information on the matter go to [Commands]({% slug maskedinput-features-commands %}) article. 
* **Customizable Validation UI**: With RadMaskedInput you could easily modify the appearance of the input-related errors, please refer to the [Validation UI]({% slug maskedinput-features-validation %}) topic for more details.
