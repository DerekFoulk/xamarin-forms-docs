# MultiPath

RadMultiPath allows you to combine several PathGeometry objects into a single element. The MultiPath contains a collection of **RadPathDefinition** objects and each of them provides a **Geometry** property as well as the same styling properties as the RadPath.

Here is a an example of RadMultiPath definition:

<snippet id='path-multipath-xaml' />

The image below shows the result:
