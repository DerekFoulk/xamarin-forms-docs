## Key features

* **Tokens Support**: With RadAutoComplete you could enable users to search for and select several items in one control. These items appear as tokens that can easily be deselected using their close button. For more details on this check [here]({% slug autocomplete-key-features%}#tokens-support).
* **Filtering Options**:  You could define the filtering behavior to display all the matches that either “StartsWith” or “Contains” the typed symbols. Read [here]({% slug autocomplete-key-features%}#filtering-options) for more details on this.
* **Watermark**: Used to give guidance to the end user on what should be entered in the text input. Check [here]({% slug autocomplete-key-features%}#watermark) for more info.
* **NoResults Message**: NoResults message appears in the popup used for the list of suggestions whenever the control cannot find any matching items. Read more about this [here]({% slug autocomplete-key-features%}#noresults-message).
* **Customizable Items**: Whenever the default template does not fit a particular scenario you could use the SuggestionItemTemplate property to define a custom template. Read [here]({%slug autocomplete-suggestion-item-template %}) for detailed instructions on how you could apply it.
