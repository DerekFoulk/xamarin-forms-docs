# Overview

**RadEntry** is a text input control that accepts string input and provides a look and feel consistent with the rest of the Telerik UI for Xamarin components through an innovative theming mechanism.

If you are new to RadEntry, see the [Getting Started]({% slug entry-getting-started%}) guide that demonstrates how to add the control to your application.

## Key features

* **Watermark**: RadEntry allows you to add a hint text as a placeholder in the control. You can use this text to guide the users what is the expected input. For more details, see the [Key Features]({% slug entry-key-features %}#watermark) article.
* **Password functionality**: You can hide the characters that users type for privacy and security reasons. For more details, see the [Key Features]({% slug entry-key-features %}#password) article.
* **Keyboard support**: You can add a virtual keyboard and specify its type, for example, `Numeric`.
* **Non-Editable (Read-Only) state**: Using a single property - `IsReadOnly`, you can specify whether the RadEntry control can be edited or not. Example and explanation can be found in [Key Features - Read-Only State]({%slug entry-key-features%}#read-only-state).
* You can define the **maximum number of symbols** allowed in the RadEntry control. For detailed explanation and example check the [Key Features - Max Length]({%slug entry-key-features%}#max-length) section.
* **Border styles**: RadEntry gives you the option to customize the look of the border around the input by using the BorderStyle property. For more details, see the [Key Features]({% slug entry-key-features %}#borderstyle).
