# Theming and Style

## BorderStyle

The **BorderStyle**(*of type Telerik.XamarinForms.Input.BorderStyle*) property allows you to customize the border around the Entry through the following properties: 

* **BorderColor**(*Color*), 
* **BorderThickness**(*Thickness*) 
* **CornerRadius**(*double*)

You could define the **BorderStyle** in the Resources of your page as shown in the example below:

<snippet id='entry-features-borderstyledefinition'/>

And then apply that Style to the Entry instance:

<snippet id='entry-features-borderstyle'/>

## Theming

>important You can find a working demo labeled **Theme** in the Entry/Features folder of the [SDK Samples Browser application]({%slug developer-focused-examples%}).
