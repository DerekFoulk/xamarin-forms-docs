## Key features

* **Tokens Support**: With RadAutoCompleteView you could enable users to search for and select several items in one control. These items appear as tokens that can easily be deselected using their close button. For more details on this check [here]({% slug autocompleteview-key-features%}#tokens-support).
* **Filtering Options**: You could define the filtering behavior to display all the matches that either “StartsWith” or “Contains” the typed symbols. Read [here]({% slug autocompleteview-key-features%}#filtering-options) for more details on this.
* **Different Suggest Modes Support**: RadAutoCompleteView exposes three different modes (Suggest, Append, SuggestAppend) for providing suggestions. For more details check [here]({%slug autocompleteview-suggest-mode%}).
* **Watermark**: Used to give guidance to the end user on what should be entered in the text input. Check [here]({% slug autocompleteview-key-features%}#watermark) for more info.
