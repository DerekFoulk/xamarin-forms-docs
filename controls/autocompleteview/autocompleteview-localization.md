# Localization

RadAutoCompleteView for Xamarin provides language localization. In short, you can translate the used across the AutoCompleteView phrases to other languages, so that your app can be adapted to different regions.

>important To learn in details about the localization process of Telerik UI for Xamarin components, please go through the common [Localization and Globalization]({%slug common-localization-and-globalization%}) topic.

In RadAutoCompleteView you can localization the following string:

| Localization Key | Default Value |
| -----------------| ------------- |
| AutoComplete_NoResultsMessage | No Results Found. | 

The localization key refers to the default message that is shown in case there are no result corresponding to the user input:
