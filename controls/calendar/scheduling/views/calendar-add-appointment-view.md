# Scheduling UI Add Appointment View

Add Appointment View allows the user to change the main appointment properties like `Title`, `Start` and `End Date`, `Detail`, `Recurrence`, whether it will be All Day appointment.

## Control Template

The control template for the **AddAppointmentView** can be found at the [following location in our SDKBrowser Application](https://github.com/telerik/xamarin-forms-sdk/blob/master/XamarinSDK/SDKBrowser/SDKBrowser/Examples/CalendarControl/SchedulingCategory/SchedulingUIViews/AddAppointmentView.xaml).

## Partial Customization Options 

In addition, to avoid editing the whole control template, there are additional properties which you can use to customize the look of the AddAppointmnetView:

* ****(**):
* ****(**):
* ****(**):
* ****(**):
* ****(**):
* ****(**):

>important These properties or the ControlTemplates can be changed by applying styles that target a specific view in the resources of the “App.xaml” file of your application.
