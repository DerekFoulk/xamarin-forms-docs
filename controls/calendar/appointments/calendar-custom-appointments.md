# Custom Appointment

A very common scenario when using RadCalendar for Xamarin is the usage of custom appointments. When you create a Custom Appointment class you gain the ability to append additional properties to the base Appointment class.

>important From R3 2020 Release you can customize the Scheduling UIs. In addition you can modify the Scheduling UIs adding custom UI within you can change the property/data in the custom appointment.

## Example

We have a sample demo in our [Telerik Sample Application](https://github.com/telerik/telerik-xamarin-forms-samples/tree/master/QSF/QSF/Examples/CalendarControl/SchedulingUICustomizationExample) where you can check how property from the Custom Appointment class is added to the Scheduling UI - AddAppointmentView screen. For this purpose you need to customze the [AddAppointmentView ControlTemplate](https://github.com/telerik/xamarin-forms-sdk/blob/master/XamarinSDK/SDKBrowser/SDKBrowser/Examples/CalendarControl/SchedulingCategory/SchedulingUIViews/AddAppointmentView.xaml).
