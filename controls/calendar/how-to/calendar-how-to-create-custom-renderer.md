# Custom Calendar Renderer #
Sometimes, you might find that certain feature is available in the native control on a given platform, but is not exposed in Xamarin Forms. This is when you would need to create a custom renderer. This will allow you to access the native control and configure it as per your needs.

## Examples ##
