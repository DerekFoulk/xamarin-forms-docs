## Key features

* **Different view modes support**: Telerik Xamarin Calendar features year, month, week, multiday and day views. Read the [View Modes]({% slug calendar-features-navigation-and-view-mode %}) topic for more information.

* **Agenda View**: Through the Agenda ViewMode you can quickly and easily check the scheduled appointments grouped by date. Fore more details on how to set it up, go to [Agenda View]({%slug calendar-agendaview %}) topic.

* **Date Selection**: RadCalendar provides three different types of selection: Single, Multiple and Range. The selected dates can be changed programmatically or when the user taps on a calendar date cell. Read the [Selection]({% slug calendar-selection %}) article for more details.

* **Appointments**: Using RadCalendar you can create appointments for a particular date out-of-the-box. For more information on this check the [Appointments]({% slug calendar-appointments %}) topic.

* **Recurrent Appointments**: The control provides the functionality to configure repeating appointments. The user has the ability to apply recurring scheduling patterns such as daily, weekly, monthly or set a range of recurrence from date to date. Check [Recurrence Overview]({%slug calendar-recurrence-overview %}) topic for more information on this.

* **Scheduling UI**: RadCalendar introduces built-in UI for creation and modification of appointments, so you could provide users with the ability to directly schedule their meetings. For more details on this check [Scheduling UI]({%slug calendar-scheduling-ui %}) topic.

* **Special and restricted slots**: You have the option to define a collection of special time slots in order to make them noticeable across the timeline of the Day and MultiDay views. Additionally, time slots can be marked as read-only, meaning that end users wouldn't be able to create or modify appointments at these slots. For detailed information on that functionality go to [Special and Restricted Slots]({% slug calendar-specialslots %}) topic.

* **Flexible Styling API**: Thanks to the controlâ€™s flexible API you have the freedom to style each separate date cell as well as the appointments according to your specifications. Read more about the Calendar styling capabilities in the [Styling]({%slug calendar-styling-cell %}) section.
