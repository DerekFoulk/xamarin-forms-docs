# Supported Types

There are two types of barcodes according to their dimensions:

## Matrix (2D) barcodes

The matrix code is a two-dimensional way for representing information. It can also be referred to as a 2D barcode or simply a 2D code. It is similar to the linear (one dimensional) barcode, but can represent more data per unit area.

Currently, **RadBarcode** supports *QR Code* and *PDF417* matrix barcode types.

## Linear (1D) barcodes

The linear (one dimensional) barcodes are made up of lines and spaces of various widths that create specific patterns. Currently, **RadBarcode** supports the following one dimensional barcode types:

|Barcode|Description|
