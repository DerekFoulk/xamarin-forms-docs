# DatePicker #

RadChatPicker control provides **DatePickerContext** that can be used to display a Calendar to choose a date.

**DatePickerContext** exposes the following properties you could use to provide a list of possible options to the user:

* SelectedDate - defines the currently selected date;
* MinDate - defines the min date that can be displayed and selected;
* MaxDate - defines the max date that can be displayed and selected;
* DisplayDate - defines a date in the current view;

Here is a quick example on how to user DatePicker:
